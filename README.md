# A simple Node.js-based web server

This repository was made during the presentation at IEEE VL/HCC 2018 as shown in https://twitter.com/junkato/status/1047840865677467649 and was deployed to https://damp-sea-15606.herokuapp.com/test as mentioned in https://twitter.com/junkato/status/1047842169757818880.

In the presentation, I prototyped this simple Express.js-based application in a [DeployGround](https://junkato.jp/deployground)-based tutorial which is available at http://tutorial.songle.jp/sync/nodejs.

## DeployGround framework

DeployGround is a framework for developing web-based tutorials that seamlessly connects the API playground and deployment target for kick-starting the application development.
